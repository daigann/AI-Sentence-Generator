# AI-Sentence-Generator
This project I built in Python is where an AI will 'attempt' to create an English sentence from reading in a book. The book I supplied is a free .txt version of Jane Eyre. 

The neural network will read the entire book, then train itself until it can spit out a somewhat coherent English sentence. I've supplied the text and source.
